Hi, I see that you guys have been working on a lot of things. 
That's great! Keep up the good work. 
I'm not sure if you guys have decided to work on github or not- 
but if you have, please let me know. 
Also, you have a lot of independent files, but you don't have a 
main file that uses all of them. Make sure you have this so 
I can test your project as well. 
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

Hey Victoria, we're mostly working in zybooks, but I know Mazin at least
is using VSCode and then copying things over here as he works.
Right now we don't have a main file that calls everything as we are working 
on individual pieces at the moment but I imagine we'll have something more 
easily testable by you this week. Thanks!

Hey Victoria, so fun fact, the run button does not work on our project anymore
no idea why, but the professor helped us set up a makefile, the commands are in the
"If you forget.txt" file.
